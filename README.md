# Blackmagic Videohub Integration for Home Assistant

Home Assistant integration for Blackmagic Videohub devices, allowing you to control your video routing matrix directly from Home Assistant.

Blackmagic provides an API to control their video switches over TCP. This integration implements a fully asynchronous interface that automatically updates Home Assistant if any changes are made to the device directly or from other clients.

Each output of your Videohub will be represented as a select entity in Home Assistant, allowing you to choose which input source is displayed on each output.

## Features

- **Source Selection**: Change which input is routed to each output
- **Name Customization**: Set custom names for inputs and outputs
- **Connection Status**: Monitor connection state with the device
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes made on the device are reflected in Home Assistant
- **UI Configuration**: Easy setup through the UI without YAML editing
- **State Recovery**: Maintains state during reconnections
- **Custom Services**: Specialized services for full device control

## Services

The integration provides several services to control your Blackmagic Videohub:

### `videohub.set_input`
Sets an input for a specific output.
- **entity_id**: The output entity to configure
- **input**: The input to select (can be input number or input name)

## Entities

### Select Entities
Each output on your Videohub will appear as a select entity, allowing you to choose which input is displayed on that output.

### Sensor Entities
- **Connection Status**: Shows if the device is connected, disconnected, or initializing

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure the device is powered on and the IP address is correct
- **No Outputs Found**: Check if the device model is supported and firmware is up to date
